## Motivation 
I was motivated to complete this project to gain additional exposure to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm and to gain additional experience with Object-relational mapping. MVC is an architectural pattern that I had not been familiarized with before and through this project, I learned how to structure my codebase efficiently. Additionally, my experience with this project taught me more about ORM to create reusable methods for querying a database. 

## Tech Used

## User Guide

### Step 1: Add + Submit a Burger to Order

1. Whenever a user submits a burger name, Eat-The-Burger will display the burger on the left side of the table below -- waiting to be devoured.

### Step 2: Devour the Burger

1. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the table.

### Step 3: Delete the Burger
1. Once a burger has been devoured, each devoured burger will have a `Delete` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be removed from the table.
